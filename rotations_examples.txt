# Use this to specify which tiles are rotations of each other.
#
# Each line begins with an X, T, I, L or /, followed by a :. The first character
# represents the type of symmetry that the tile has. After that, list the
# characters for each possible 90-degree rotation. Each list ends with a line
# break and is whitespace-sensitive (a space character is a valid rotation).
